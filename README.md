## 📜 History

This project was done in just 48h without having any previous Unity experience. It was developed by [dsanchez](https://github.com/diegosanchezstrange) and [me](https://github.com/Brandommoore) truly with a lot of love ❤, and with a lot of desire and emotion. We are in second position of the 42 Madrid FallJam, and with very good reviews about the game. Here some curiosities...

- 🎵 Music
	- 🎻 **BSO.** The entire soundtrack of the game is developed generatively (through code) in SonicPi, and later exported mastered for its implementation in the game.
	- 🎶 **Music menu.** We made a Shazam to the music that the coffee machine that we have on campus plays when it gives you a coffee. We thought it was a wonderful wink after so many coffees ☕
- 📂 Assets
	- 🎞 **Sprites.** We think that we are always surrounded by games with very good graphics and with many colors. So we use a world of 8bits and monochrome. The only elements that contain colors are the vegetation in the key points of the levels, and in the gems. These sprites are colored pixel by pixel to avoid losing the intended aesthetic.
	- 📺 **TV**. The idea came to me that being a retro style game, it would be great to be able to see the game as if it were being played on an old TV. The TV shown is a Rubin TV, rendered specifically for use as an in-game asset.
- 🔴 Extremely difficult game. It is a game in which there is no limit of lives. The only limit there is is your frustration. Seriously, it's very difficult.
